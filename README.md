After starting app, click view reports to see 3 reports, or use login to pull up different access forms. 
Example:
For admins:
userID: 1
password: password1 

For managers:
userID: 3
password: password3

For staff:
userID: 7
password: password7

Then click through the options that pop up to add, modify, or remove data from the database; order management for managers and staff are the same.
